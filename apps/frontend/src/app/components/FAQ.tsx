        This course is aimed at first-year college students, high school students, and professionals in all fields who are interested in learning basic programming skills. It is a self-contained treatment intended for people with little or no previous experience in programming. It is also appropriate for people who know another programming language but want to learn Java.
        <br />
        At Princeton, over 50% of all undergraduates take the course, including students majoring in engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, not just computer science.
